abstract = {Static analyses provide the semantic foundation for tools ranging from optimizing compilers to refactoring browsers and advanced debuggers. Unfortunately, developing new analysis specifications and implementations is often difficult and error prone. Since analysis specifications are generally written in a declarative style, logic programming presents an attractive model for producing executable specifications of analyses. However, prior work on using logic programming for program analysis has focused exclusively on solving constraints derived from program texts by an external preprocessor. In this paper, we present DIMPLE, an analysis framework for Java bytecodes implemented in the Yap Prolog system [8]. DIMPLE provides both a representation of Java bytecodes in a database of relations and a declarative domain-specific language for specifying new analyses as queries over this database. DIMPLE thus enables researchers to use logic programming for every step of the analysis development process, from specification to prototype to implementation. We demonstrate that our approach facilitates rapid prototyping of new program analyses and produces executable analysis implementations that are speed-competitive with specialized analysis toolkits.},

abstract = {We present a new approach for building source-to-source transformations that can run on multiple programming languages, based on a new way of representing programs called incremental parametric syntax. We implement this approach in Haskell in our Cubix system, and construct incremental parametric syntaxes for C, Java, JavaScript, Lua, and Python. We demonstrate a whole-program refactoring tool that runs on all of them, along with three smaller transformations that each run on several. Our evaluation shows that (1) once a transformation is written, little work is required to configure it for a new language (2) transformations built this way output readable code which preserve the structure of the original, according to participants in our human study, and (3) our transformations can still handle language corner-cases, as validated on compiler test suites.},

We have designed a new code synthesis engine for Nopol based on dynamic exploration, it is called DynaMoth. The main design goal is to be able to generate patches with method calls. We evaluate DynaMoth over 224 of the Defects4J dataset. The evaluation shows that Nopol with DynaMoth is capable of synthesizing patches and enables Nopol to repair new bugs of the dataset.},

abstract = {Designing and crafting a static program analysis is challenging due to the complexity of the task at hand. Among the challenges are modelling the semantics of the input language, finding suitable abstractions for the analysis, and handwriting efficient code for the analysis in a traditional imperative language such as C++. Hence, the development of static program analysis tools is costly in terms of development time and resources for real world languages. To overcome, or at least alleviate the costs of developing a static program analysis, Datalog has been proposed as a domain specific language (DSL). With Datalog, a designer expresses a static program analysis in the form of a logical specification. While a domain specific language approach aids in the ease of development of program analyses, it is commonly accepted that such an approach has worse runtime performance than handcrafted static analysis tools. In this work, we introduce a new program synthesis methodology for Datalog specifications to produce highly efficient monolithic C++ analyzers. The synthesis technique requires the re-interpretation of the semi-naive evaluation as a scaffolding for translation using partial evaluation. To achieve high-performance, we employ staged-compilation techniques and specialize the underlying relational data structures for a given Datalog specification. Experimentation on benchmarks for large-scale program analysis validates the superior performance of our approach over available Datalog tools and demonstrates our competitiveness with state-of-the-art handcrafted tools.},

abstract = {Context
Almost twenty years after the first release of TopLink for Java, Object-Relational Mapping Solutions (ORMSs) are available at every popular development platform, providing useful tools for developers to deal with the impedance mismatch problem. However, no matter how ubiquitous these solutions are, this essential problem remains as challenging as ever. Different solutions, each with a particular vocabulary, are difficult to learn, and make the impedance problem looks deceptively simpler than it really is.
Objective
The objective of this paper is to identify, discuss, and organize the knowledge concerning ORMSs, helping designers towards making better informed decisions about designing and implementing their models, focusing at the static view of persistence mapping.
Method
This paper presents a survey with nine ORMSs, selected from the top ten development platforms in popularity. Each ORMS was assessed, by documentation review and experience, in relation to architectural and structural patterns, selected from literature, and its characteristics and implementation options, including platform specific particularities.
Results
We found out that all studied ORMSs followed architectural and structural patterns in the literature, but often with distinct nomenclature, and some singularities. Many decisions, depending on how patterns are implemented and configured, affect how class models should be adapted, in order to create practical mappings to the database.
Conclusion
This survey identified what structural patterns each ORMS followed, highlighting major structural decisions a designer must take, and its consequences, in order to turn analysis models into object oriented systems. It also offers a pattern based set of characteristics that developers can use as a baseline to make their own assessments of ORMSs.}

title = "Classical logic event calculus as answer set programming",
abstract = "Recently, Ferraris, Lee and Lifschitz presented a generalized definition of a stable model that applies to the syntax of arbitrary first-order sentences, under which a logic program is viewed as a special class of first-order sentences. The new definition of a stable model is similar to the definition of circumscription, and can even be characterized in terms of circumscription. In this paper, we show the opposite direction, that is, how to embed circumscription into the new stable model semantics, and based on this, how to turn some versions of the classical logic event calculus into the general language of stable models. By turning the latter to answer set programs under certain conditions, we show that answer set solvers can be used for classical logic event calculus reasoning, allowing more expressive query answering than what can be handled by the current SAT-based implementations of the event calculus. We prove the correctness of our translation method and compare our work with the related work by Mueller.",

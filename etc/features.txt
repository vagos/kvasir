properties to extract from program/function:
  - io pairs
  - function signature
  - function type
  - source code
  - cfg
  - system call trace
  - touched/modified files
  - sql queries

Daikon invariants?

Translation from one language to the other. You take the IO pairs in Javascript and you turn them into the same values in Haskell.

How do we have data structures shared between plugins? Like IO pairs, function signatures, etc.?
  Probably plugins can handle this from their precondition hook. Example: Property X needs to be already extracted from the original program

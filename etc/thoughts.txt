a declarative interface for keeping/removing properties from a function

maybe a function is parallelized but you want to have it run in a single thread
maybe you say what properties need to hold and the system figures out what properties to keep or remove
by having more abstract properties, the synthesizer might be able to make optimizations
eg if instead of concrete output values you have intervals, the synthesizer might be able to make optimizations
